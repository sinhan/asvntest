/**
 * An abstract implementation of the JavaSamplerClient interface.
 * This implementation provides default implementations of most
 * of the methods in the interface, as well as some convenience
 * methods, in order to simplify development of JavaSamplerClient
 * implementations.
 * <p>
 * While it may be necessary to make changes to the JavaSamplerClient
 * interface from time to time (therefore requiring changes to any
 * implementations of this interface), we intend to make this abstract
 * class provide reasonable implementations of any new methods so that
 * subclasses do not necessarily need to be updated for new versions.
 * Therefore, when creating a new JavaSamplerClient implementation,
 * developers are encouraged to subclass this abstract class rather
 * than implementing the JavaSamplerClient interface directly.
 * Implementing JavaSamplerClient directly will continue to be
 * supported for cases where extending this class is not possible
 * (for example, when the client class is already a subclass of some
 * other class).
 * <p>
 * The runTest() method of JavaSamplerClient does not have a default
 * implementation here, so subclasses must define at least this method.
 * It may be useful to override other methods as well.
 * 
 * @see JavaSamplerClient#runTest(JavaSamplerContext)
