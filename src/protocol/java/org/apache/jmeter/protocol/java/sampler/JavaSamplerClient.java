/**
 * This interface defines the interactions between the JavaSampler
 * and external Java programs which can be executed by JMeter.  Any
 * Java class which wants to be executed as a JMeter test must
 * implement this interface (either directly or indirectly through
 * AbstractJavaSamplerClient).
 * <p>
 * JMeter will create one instance of a JavaSamplerClient implementation
 * for each user/thread in the test.  Additional instances may be
 * created for internal use by JMeter (for example, to find out
 * what parameters are supported by the client).
 * <p>
 * When the test is started, setupTest() will be called on each
 * thread's JavaSamplerClient instance to initialize the client.
 * Then runTest() will be called for each iteration of the test.
 * Finally, teardownTest() will be called to allow the client
 * to do any necessary clean-up.
 * <p>
 * The JMeter JavaSampler GUI allows a list of parameters to be
 * defined for the test.  These are passed to the various test
 * methods through the {@link JavaSamplerContext}.  A list of default
 * parameters can be defined through the getDefaultParameters()
 * method.  These parameters and any default values associated
 * with them will be shown in the GUI.  Users can add other
 * parameters as well.
 * <p>
 * When possible, Java tests should extend {@link AbstractJavaSamplerClient
 * AbstractJavaSamplerClient} rather than implementing JavaSamplerClient
 * directly.  This should protect your tests from future changes to the
 * interface.  While it may be necessary to make changes to the
 * JavaSamplerClient interface from time to time (therefore requiring changes
 * to any implementations of this interface), we intend to make this abstract
 * class provide reasonable default implementations of any new methods so that
 * subclasses do not necessarily need to be updated for new versions. 
 * Implementing JavaSamplerClient directly will continue to be
 * supported for cases where extending this class is not possible
 * (for example, when the client class is already a subclass of some
 * other class).
 * <p>
 * See {@link org.apache.jmeter.protocol.java.test.SleepTest} for an
 * example of how to implement this interface.
