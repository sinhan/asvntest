// The developers of JMeter and Apache are greatful to the developers
// of HTMLParser for giving Apache Software Foundation a non-exclusive
// license. The performance benefits of HTMLParser are clear and the
// users of JMeter will benefit from the hard work the HTMLParser
// team. For detailed information about HTMLParser, the project is
// hosted on sourceforge at http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/.
//
// HTMLParser was originally created by Somik Raha in 2000. Since then
// a healthy community of users has formed and helped refine the
// design so that it is able to tackle the difficult task of parsing
// dirty HTML. Derrick Oswald is the current lead developer and was kind
// enough to assist JMeter.
