/**
 * Title: Module Controller
 * The goal of ModuleController is to add modularity to JMeter. The general idea
 * is that web applications consist of small units of functionality (i.e.
 * Logon, Create Account, Logoff...) which consist of requests that implement
 * the functionality. These small units of functionality can be stored in
 * SimpleControllers as modules that can be linked together quickly to form
 * tests. ModuleController facilitates this by acting as a pointer to any
 * controller that sits under the WorkBench. The controller and it's subelements
 * will be substituted in place of the ModuleController at runtime. Config
 * elements can be attached to the ModuleController to alter the functionality
 * (which user logs in, which account is created, etc.) of the module.
