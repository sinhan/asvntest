/**
 * A simple interface for measuring time intervals. An instance of this goes
 * through the following lifecycle states:
 * <dl>
 * <dt><em>ready</em></dt>
 * <dd>timer is ready to start a new measurement</dd>
 * <dt><em>started</em></dt>
 * <dd>timer has recorded the starting time interval point</dd>
 * <dt><em>stopped</em></dt>
 * <dd>timer has recorded the ending time interval point</dd>
 * </dl>
 * See individual methods for details.
 * <p>
 * If this library has been compiled with
 * {@link ITimerConstants#DO_STATE_CHECKS} set to 'true' the implementation will
 * enforce this lifecycle model and throw IllegalStateException when it is
 * violated.
