/**
 * SSL Manager Command.  The SSL Manager provides a mechanism to change your
 * client authentication if required by the server.  If you have JSSE 1.0.2
 * installed, you can select your client identity from a list of installed keys.
 * You can also change your keystore.  JSSE 1.0.2 allows you to export a PKCS#12
 * key from Netscape 4.04 or higher and use it in a read only format.  You must
 * supply a password that is greater than six characters due to limitations in
 * the keytool program--and possibly the rest of the system.
 * <p>
 * By selecting a *.p12 file as your keystore (your PKCS#12) format file, you
 * can have a whopping one key keystore.  The advantage is that you can test a
 * connection using the assigned Certificate from a Certificate Authority.
