 * Implementing this interface indicates that the class is
 * a JMeter GUI Component.  A JMeter GUI Component is essentially 
 * the GUI display code associated with a JMeter Test Element.  The writer of
 * the component must take care to make the component be consistent with the
 * rest of JMeter's GUI look and feel and behavior.  Use of the provided abstract
 * classes is highly recommended to make this task easier.
