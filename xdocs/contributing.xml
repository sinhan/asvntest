<p>
The Jakarta Project is an open volunteer project. This means that anyone may
partecipate to the development process even actively (writing, discussing, proposing code)
or passively (listening and learning). You are more than welcome to join our group of
developers if you feel you are ready for it and wish to give a hand.

If you want more info about Jakarta development (mailing list, CVS info, code
style, subprojects, people to ask) check out our web site:
