<section name="3. Building a Test Plan">
<p>A test plan describes a series of steps JMeter will execute when run.  A complete
test plan will consiste of one or more Thread Groups, logic conrollers, sample generating
controllers, listeners, timers, assertions, and configuration elements.
</p>

<subsection name="3.1 Adding and Removing Elements" anchor="add_remove">
<p>Adding <a href="test_plan.html">elements to a test plan</a> can be done by right-clicking on an element in the
tree, and choosing a new element from the "add" list.  Alternatively, elements can
be loaded from file and added by choosing the "open" option.  </p>

<p>To remove an element, make sure the element is selected, right-click on the element,
and choose the "remove" option.</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="3.2 Loading and Saving Elements" anchor="load_save">
<p>To load an element from file, right click on the existing tree element to which
you want to add the loaded element, and select the "open" option.  Choose the file where
your elements are saved.  JMeter will load the elements into the tree.</p>

<p>To save tree elements, right click on an element and choose the "save" option.
JMeter will save the element selected, plus all child elements beneath it.  In this way,
you can save test tree fragments, individual elements, or the entire test plan.</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="3.3 Configuring Tree Elements" anchor="config_element">
<p>Any element in the test tree will present controls in JMeter's right-hand frame.  These
controls allow you to configure the behavior of that particular test element.  What can be
configured for an element depends on what type of element it is.</p>

<note>The Test Tree itself can be manipulated by dragging and dropping components around the test tree.</note>
</subsection>

<subsection name="3.4 Running a Test Plan" anchor="run">
<p>To run your test plan, choose "start" from the "run" menu item.  To stop your test
plan, choose "stop" from the same menu.  JMeter does not automatically give any
indication of whether it is currently running.  Some listeners make it obvious if
JMeter is running, but the only way to be sure is to check the "run" menu.  If "start"
is disabled, and "stop" is enabled, JMeter is running your test plan (or, at least, it
thinks it is).</p>
