<p><b>Changes are chronologically ordered from top (most recent) to bottom 
(least recent)</b></p>  

<b>Changes: for more info, contact <a href="mailto:mstover1@apache.org">Michael Stover</a></b>

<h3>Version 2.0</h3>
<ul>
	<li>HTML parsing improved; now has choice of 3 parsers, and most embedded elements can now be detected and downloaded.</li>
<li>Redirects can now be delegated to URLConnection by defining the JMeter property HTTPSamper.delegateRedirects=true (default is false) </li>
<li>Stop Thread and Stop Test methods added for Samplers and Assertions etc. Samplers can call setStopThread(true) or setStopTest(true) if they detect an error that needs to stop the thread of the test after the sample has been processed </li>
<li>Thread Group Gui now has an extra pane to specify what happens after a Sampler error: Continue (as now), Stop Thread or Stop Test. 
    This needs to be extended to a lower level at some stage. </li>
<li>Added Shutdown to Run Menu. This is the same as Stop except that it lets the Threads finish normally (i.e. after the next sample has been completed) </li>
<li>Remote samples can be cached until the end of a test by defining the property hold_samples=true when running the server.
More work is needed to be able to control this from the GUI </li>
<li>Proxy server has option to skip recording browser headers </li>

<li>Scheduler ignores start if it has already passed </li>
<li>Scheduler now has delay function </li>
<li>added Summariser test element (mainly for non-GUI) testing. This prints summary statistics to System.out and/or the log file every so oftem (3 minutes by default). Multiple summarisers can be used; samples are accumulated by summariser name. </li>
<li>Extra Proxy Server options: 
Create all samplers with keep-alive disabled 
Add Separator markers between sets of samples 
Add Response Assertion to first sampler in each set </li>

      <li>_StringFromFile() funtion can now use a variable or function for the file name </li>
	</ul>

<h3>Version 1.5</h3> 
<ul>   
	<li>Abstracted out the concept of the Sampler, SamplerController, and TestSample.   
		A Sampler represents code that understands a protocol (such as HTTP, 
		or FTP, RMI,   SMTP, etc..).  It is the code that actually makes the 
		connection to whatever is   being tested.   A SamplerController 
		represents code that understands how to organize and run a group   
		of test samples.  It is what binds together a Sampler and it's test 
		samples and runs them.   A TestSample represents code that understands 
		how to gather information from the   user about a particular test.  
		For a website, it would represent a URL and any   information to be sent 
		with the URL.</li>   
	<li>The UI has been updated to make entering test samples more convenient.</li>   
	<li>Thread groups have been added, allowing a user to setup multiple test to run   
		concurrently, and to allow sharing of test samples between those tests.</li>   
	<li>It is now possible to save and load test samples.</li>   
	<li>....and many more minor changes/improvements...</li> 
</ul>
