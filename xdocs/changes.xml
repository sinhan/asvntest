<h1>Version 2.3.3</h1>

<h2>Summary of main changes</h2>

<p>
The handling of test closedown is much improved. 
The gradual "Shutdown" command now waits until all threads have stopped,
and does not report an error if threads don't stop within 5 seconds.
The immediate "Stop" command can now be used if "Shutdown" takes too long.
Also the immediate "Stop" command is able to interrupt samplers which support the new Interruptible interface (e.g. HTTP and SOAP, FTP).
This allows immediate completion of pending responses.
Non-GUI mode tests can also now be sent a "Shutdown" or "Stop" message.
<complink name="Test Action"/> now supports a "Stop Now" action, 
as do the <complink name="Thread Group"/> and <complink name="Result Status Action Handler"/> Post Processor elements.
</p>

<p>
HTTP Cookie handling is improved, and HTTP POST can now use variable file names correctly.
HTTP, SOAP/XML-RPC and WebService(SOAP) sampler character encodings updated to be more consistent.
HTTP Samplers now support connection and response timeouts (requires JVM 1.5 for the HTTP Java sampler).
Together with the closedown improvements described above, this should avoid most cases where a test run hangs.
Multiple Header Manager elements are now supported for a single HTTP sampler.
The Proxy Server is improved, and no longer stores "Host" headers by default.
</p>

<p>
JDBC Request can optionally save the results of Select statements to variables.
JDBC Request now handles quoted strings and UTF-8, and can handle arbitrary variable types.
</p>

<p>
There are several new <a href="usermanual/functions.html">functions</a>:
__char() function: allows arbitrary Unicode characters to be entered in fields.
__unescape() function: allows Java-escaped strings to be used.
_unescapeHtml() function: decodes Html-encoded text.
__escapeHtml() function: encodes text using Html-encoding. 
A reference to a missing function - e.g. ${__missing(a)} - is now treated the same as a missing variable.
Previously the function name - and leading { - were dropped. This makes it easier to debug test plans.
</p>

<p>
Some Assertions can now be applied to sub-samples as well as (or instead of) just the parent sample.
There is a new <complink name="Random Variable"/> Configuration element.
</p>

<p>
JMS samplers are much improved (see details below). The <complink name="TCP Sampler"/> now supports some additional clients and is a bit more flexible.
</p>

<p>
Client-server mode has been improved, and the server can optionally use a fixed RMI port, which should help with setting up firewalls. 
</p>

<p>
Various I18N changes have been made; language change works better (though not perfect yet).
There are improved French translations as well as new Polish and Brazilian Portugese translations.
</p>

<p>
The BeanShell jar is now included with the binary archive; there is no need to download it separately. 
</p>

<!--  ========================= End of summary ===================================== -->

<h2>Known bugs</h2>

<p>
The Include Controller has some problems in non-GUI mode. 
In particular, it can cause a NullPointerException if there are two include controllers with the same name.
</p>

<p>Once Only controller behaves correctly under a Thread Group or Loop Controller,
but otherwise its behaviour is not consistent (or clearly specified).</p>

<p>
The menu item Options / Choose Language does not change all the displayed text to the new language.
[The behaviour has improved, but language change is still not fully working]
To override the default local language fully, set the JMeter property "language" before starting JMeter. 
</p>

<h2>Incompatible changes</h2>
<p>
When loading sample results from a file, previous results are no longer cleared.
This allows one to merge multiple files.
If the previous behaviour is required,
use the menu item Run/Clear (Ctrl+Shift+E) or Run/Clear All (Ctrl+E) before loading the file.
</p>
<p>
The test elements "Save Results to a file" and "Generate Summary Results" are now shown as Listeners.
They were previously shown as Post-Processors, even though they are implemented as Listeners.
</p>
<p>
The Cookie Manager no longer saves incoming cookies as variables by default.
To save cookies as variables, define the property "CookieManager.save.cookies=true".
Also, cookies names are prefixed with "COOKIE_" before they are stored (this avoids accidental corruption of local variables)
To revert to the original behaviour, define the property "CookieManager.name.prefix= " (one or more spaces).
</p>
<p>
The Counter element is now shown as a Configuration element.
It was previously shown as a Pre-Processor, even though it is implemented as a Config item.
</p>
<p>
The above changes only affect the icons that are displayed and the locations in the GUI pop-up menus.
They do not affect test plans or test behaviour.
</p>
<p>
The PreProcessors are now invoked directly by the JMeterThread class,
rather than by the TestCompiler#configureSampler() method. (JMeterThread handles the PostProcessors).
This does not affect test plans or behaviour, but could perhaps affect 3rd party add-ons (very unlikely).
</p>
<p>
Moved the Scoping Rules sub-section from Section 3. "Building a Test Plan"  to Section 4. "Elements of a test plan"
</p>

<p>
The While controller now trims leading and trailing spaces from the condition value before it is compared
with LAST, blank or false.
</p>

<p>
The "threadName" variable in the _jexl() and __javaScript() functions was previously misspelt as "theadName".
</p>

<p>
The following deprecated methods were removed from JOrphanUtils: booleanToString(boolean) and valueOf(boolean).
Java 1.4+ has these methods in the Boolean class.
</p>

<p>
The TestElement interface has some new methods:
<ul>
<li>void setProperty(String key, String value, String dflt)</li>
<li>void setProperty(String key, boolean value, boolean dflt)</li>
<li>void setProperty(String key, int value)</li>
<li>void setProperty(String key, int value, int dflt)</li>
<li>int getPropertyAsInt(String key, int defaultValue)</li>
</ul>
These are implemented in the AbstractTestElement class which all elements should extend so this is unlikely to cause a problem.
</p>
