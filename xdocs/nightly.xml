	<h2>Where are the nightly builds?</h2>
	<p>There are at present two sources of nightly builds:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Zips: <a href="http://gump.covalent.net/jars/latest/jakarta-jmeter/">
			http://gump.covalent.net/jars/latest/jakarta-jmeter/</a>
			Log: <a href="http://gump.covalent.net/log/jakarta-jmeter-test.html">Test log</a>
		</li>
		<li>Zips: <a href="http://lsd.student.utwente.nl/gump/jars/jakarta-jmeter/jars/">
			http://lsd.student.utwente.nl/gump/jars/jakarta-jmeter/jars/</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h2>What do they consist of?</h2>
<p>
JMeter is distributed as a set of zip (or tar or tar-gz) archive files.

The files are called:
<ul>
<li>jakarta-jmeter-{version}_bin.zip - JMeter binaries</li>
<li>jakarta-jmeter-{version}_lib.zip - 3rd party jar files</li>
<li>jakarta-jmeter-{version}_src.zip - JMeter source</li>
<li>jakarta-jmeter-{version}_api.zip - JMeter Javadoc</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installing JMeter runtime</h2>
Download the _bin and _lib files
<br/>
Unpack the archives into the same directory structure
<br/>

The other archives are not needed to run JMeter.
</p>
<h2>Warning - please note!</h2>
<p>
	The nightly builds may or may not work properly - or at all.<br/>
	Check the corresponding test log (if it still exists) to see if the build has any major problems.
	If there is a problem with a particular version, it may be worth trying again in a day or two.
