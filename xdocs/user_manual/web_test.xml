<p>
The Web Test controller is a generative controller whose function is to create a single test case for HTTP applications.
The Web Test allows you to configure a URL sample:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Protocol</b>: HTTP or HTTPS</li>
<li><b>Method</b>: GET or POST</li>
<li><b>Domain</b>: Host name of the server being tested</li>
<li><b>Port</b>: Port to connect to the server on</li>
<li><b>Path</b>: File path.  This represent the part of the URL following the domain name, but before any query string that may be involved</li>
<li><b>Paramter Table</b>: These are the arguments that will make up the query string.  This string will be appended to the URL if Method=GET, and it will be sent in a separate stream if Method=POST.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, there are two check selections that allow you to control whether JMeter will also download any images found on
the page returned by the server, or to tell JMeter that it should upload a file using multipart-form format.  If you are uploading a file, JMeter requires three additional parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>File</b>: The path to the file being uploaded</li>
<li><b>Field Name</b>: The name of the upload field (ie, if it were a web page, there would be an input field with a name - this is that name)</li>
<li><b>MimeType</b>: The mimetype of the document being uploaded</li>
</ul>
