<p>
A logical controller is a controller that regulates the iterative behavior of
it's sub-controllers, and sometimes, it can also affect the behavior of its
parent controller indirectly.  A logical controller can also modify test samples
that pass through it. The essential distinction between a logical controller and a
<a href="test_samples.html">generative controller</a> is that logical controllers create no test samples by
themselves.  If you add a logical controller to the test tree with no sub-conrollers,
then it can have no effect on the test.  It's only useful as a parent of other
<a href="test_samples.html">sample generating controllers</a>.
