<section name="Timers">
<p>Timers help program flow by controlling how long JMeter's engine delays between
each sample attempt.  Each sampling thread that runs will pause between every
sample, depending on which timers have been chosen.
</p>
<p>Timers are added to ThreadGroups.  Configuring a timer is generally self
explanatory.  Multiple timers can be added to a ThreadGroup.  In this case, the
sampling thread will sum results from each timer, and delay for that period of time.
