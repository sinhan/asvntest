<section name="Generative Controllers">
<p>
A Generative Controller is a controller that controls the creation of test cases.
Generative Controllers do not contain sub-controllers .  Their purpose is to describe a specific test case and to
provide the logic necessary to create that test case.
</p>

<p>Generative Controllers can hold config elements that provide default values, or additional information
about the test.</p>

<p>
Although one can add cookie managers and authorization managers, it's almost always
preferable to add such elements at the ThreadGroup level.
