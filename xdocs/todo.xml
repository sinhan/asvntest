<section name="ToDo List">
<p>
List of those things yet to do, wishes, dreams, etc.. (in no particular
order)
</p>
<ul>
  <li><STRONG>New modules:</STRONG></li>
  <ul>
	<li>RMI</li>
	<li>SMTP</li>
	<li>JINI</li>
	<li>Corba</li>
	<li>HTTP-multiPart</li>
	<li>Local Java Object</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Adding reporters:</strong> Reporters would offer report generation based
		  on data collected by JMeter.  For those looking for more information than
		  simply time per sample and average time, a reporter should be available.
		  Examples could include statistical reports, accuracy reports (eg what exactly
		  did the web page return - this could be used for QA testing).</li>

  <li><strong>Dynamic control while JMeter runs</strong> Enable users to change
  options while JMeter runs - ie change number of threads running, start and stop
  thread groups individually, add test samples on the fly, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Drag n Drop</strong> allow users to move test elements around the tree
  easily</li>
  <li><b>OffLine reporting</b> - Enable the various visualizers to display test results
  only after the run is finished.  This would facilitate heavier loads since constantly
  updating the GUI takes up so much processing</li>
  <li><b>Running indicator</b> - JMeter needs to do something lightweight, yet effective,
  to indicate to the user when it is running a test</li>
</ul>
