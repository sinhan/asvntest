                                Version 1.1


  What is it?
  -----------

  Apache JMeter is a 100% pure Java application designed to test
  and measure the performance of URL retrieval and it may be used
  as a highly portable server benchmark as well as multiclient
  load generator.

  The Latest Version
  ------------------

  Details of the latest version can be found on the Java Apache 
  Project web site (http://java.apache.org).

  Requirements
  ------------

  The following requirements exist for installing Apache JMeter:

   o  Java Interpreter:

      A fully compliant Java 1.1 Runtime Environment is required for 
      Apache JMeter to execute. Since Apache JMeter uses _only_ standard
      Java APIs (java.*), please, do not file in a bug report if your 
      JRE fails to execute Apache JMeter because a class implementation
      is missing, or not fully compliant.

   o  Java JFC (Swing components):

      These GUI extentions are required for proper functioning. 
      
      Due to incompatibility in the package names, the precompiled version 
      works only with Swing placed under the packages "javax.swing.*" while
      other placing are not supported because considered non-standard.
      
   o  Java Compiler [OPTIONAL]:

      A Java compiler is not needed since the distribution includes a 
      precompiled java binary archive. Note that a compiler is required
      if you plan to build plugin classes for Apache JMeter.
