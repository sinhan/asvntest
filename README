  What is it?
  -----------

  Apache JMeter is a 100% pure Java application designed to test
  and measure performance.  It may be used
  as a highly portable server benchmark as well as multiclient
  load generator.

  The Latest Version
  ------------------

  Details of the latest version can be found on the Java Apache 
  Project web site (http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter).

  Requirements
  ------------

  The following requirements exist for running Apache JMeter:

   o  Java Interpreter:

      A fully compliant Java 1.3 Runtime Environment is required (a Java 1.4
      Runtime Environment is recomended) for Apache JMeter to execute. 

   o  Optional jars:
   
      Some jars are not included with JMeter. 
      If required, these should be downloaded and placed in the lib directory
   
      BeanShell (bsh.jar) - www.beanshell.org
      JavaMail (activation.jar, mail.jar) - java.sun.com
      JMS (jms.jar) - java.sun.com

   o  Java Compiler [OPTIONAL]:

      A Java compiler is not needed since the distribution includes a 
      precompiled java binary archive. Note that a compiler is required
      if you plan to build plugin classes for Apache JMeter.

  Installation Instructions
  -------------------------

  Note that spaces in directory names can cause problems.

  - Release builds
  Unpack the binary archive into a suitable directory structure.
  
  - Nightly builds
  Unpack BOTH the _bin and _lib archives into the SAME directory structure
  
  Running JMeter
  --------------
  
  Change to the bin directory and run the jmeter (Un*x) or jmeter.bat (Windows) file.
  
  For Windows, there are also some other scripts:
  
  jmeter-n.bat - drop a JMX file on this and it will run it as a non-GUI test
  jmeter-t.bat - drop a JMX file on this and it will open the file for running a GUI test
  
  Documentation
  -------------
  The documentation available as of the date of this release is
  also included, in HTML format, in the docs/ directory, and it may
  be browsed starting from the file called index.html.

  Build instructions
  ------------------
  
  - Release builds
  Unpack both the binary and source archives into the same directory structure
  
  - Nightly builds
  Unpack the _src and _lib archives into the same directory structure
  
  In both cases, any optional jars (see above) can be placed in either lib or lib/opt.
  Jars in lib/opt will be used for building JMeter, but won't be used at run-time.
  [This is useful for testing what happens if the optional jars are not downloaded
  by other JMeter users].

  JMeter is built using Ant.
  
  Change to the top-level directory and issue the command:
  
  ant

  This will compile the application and enable you to run jmeter from the bin
  directory.
